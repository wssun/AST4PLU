# Introduction
This subdirectory contains code for the code clone detection task using BiLSTM, Transformer, Child-Sum TreeLSTM, N-ary TreeLSTM and AST-Trans.

**sequence-model** - Contrains code for BiLSTM and Transformer.

**tree-lstm** - Contains code for Child-Sum TreeLSTM and N-ary TreeLSTM.

**ast-trans** - Contrains code for AST-Trans.

For more details about how to run the experiment and specific parameter settings, please refer to the README in each subdirectory.
